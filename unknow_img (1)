<div dir="ltr">Hi again everyone,
<div><br>
</div>
<div>I would like to clarify two things:</div>
<div>1. JPIC only reimburses electronic components up to 50 RMB.<br>
</div>
<div>2. I understand many of the groups had spent a fortune in materials for the exterior design (e.g. chassis, mechanical parts, etc.). While we cannot reimburse such expense, it is important that you minimise the cost of prototype - e.g. by using recycled
 materials and/or cost-effective design. I will require all groups to estimate the overall cost in manufacturing your product in your report. You will be scored based on the cost effectiveness.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Thanks for all questions to Andy and me so far. We are always happy to take any of your enquiries, whenever you are not clear about the design &amp; build project!</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Regards,</div>
<div>Matthew</div>

<div dir="ltr">Dear JP Year 2 Students,<br>
<br>
On Sunday, Mr Andy Watson has introduced the &quot;Design and Build&quot; short semester to all of you. I believe by now you should be working very hard on the project.<br>
<br>
As the D&amp;B coordinator this year, I would like to clarify about the usage of extra components or modules (outside the provided kit) in the project:<br>
- You should consider to use as many components/modules from the kit as you can. They are already very good.<br>
- If you still wish to add some components/modules that not available from the kit, you may acquire them from the market (e.g. Taobao). However, you *CANNOT* spend more than 50 RMB for them. This is to ensure fairness among all groups.<br>
- The JP Innovation Centre (JPIC) is happy to reimburse your expense, given that you can provide (i) receipt(s) (FaPiao) for all items purchased and (ii) a justification (around 100 words) on why you need and how the items are used in the project (see the form
 attached).<br>
- Please prepare and submit the documents stated on the demonstration evening.<br>
<br>
Please be reminded that it is not necessary to use extra components since the Arduino kit is already very all-rounded.<br>
<br>
For enquiries, please get in touch with Mr Andy Watson (<a href="mailto:andy.watson@qmul.ac.uk" target="_blank">andy.watson@qmul.ac.uk</a>) through emails.<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Dr Matthew Tang<br>
D&amp;B Coordinator 2019/20<br>
